Jokes aside, welcome to another one of my JavaFX projects.  
Since i started learning programming, i have watched A LOT of video courses, and of course i was manually making and organizing a collection of playlists for each of them.  
Then i realized that using the things i learned while watching the courses i could automatize this process by making a tool that will make a playlist instead of me, leaving me with more time to study  
The result of that relization is this project. :smile: 

### Usage

Run the Main.java class, upon startup user interface will be displayed.

**Action options**
+ *Create a playlist for the chosen directory*  
This option will create only one playlist from the files found in the specified directory.
+ *Create a playlist for each subdirectory of the chosen directory*  
This option will create one playlist per first level sub-directory that is found in the specified directory.  
And it will create one more playlist, by combining all other individual sub-directory level playlists.

_Source directory_ - select the folder where the app can find files to add to the playlist.

_Save to_ - choose a directory where you want to save the playlist

_Playlist name_ - this appears if the first action option is selected, choose a name for the playlist that is about to be created

_Folder name_ - this appears if the second action option is selected, choose a name for the folder where all created playlists will be saved, the title of each playlist will be the name of the directory from which that playlist was created. 

_Status_ - here you can see information about what process is currently running in the app, or error messages.

_Theme_ - at the bottom left corner choose one of the radio button options to change the theme, this has nothing to do with the playlist, it is here purely for aesthetics of the app.

_Create_ - Finally click this button when you have entered all the required information.
